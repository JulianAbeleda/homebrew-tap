  def caveats; <<~EOS
    Cask #{token} related executables like 'gameterm', 'gameterm-gui',
    'gameterm-mux-server', are linked into
      /usr/local/bin/    for x86 Mac,
      /opt/homebrew/bin/ for M1 Mac.

    Removal of them is ensured by 'brew uninstall --cask #{token}'.

    GameTerm.app is ad-hoc signed (not notarized), so macOS Gatekeeper
    may block the first launch. Either right-click the app and choose
    Open once, or clear the quarantine attribute:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/GameTerm.app

    Homebrew 6+ requires trusting this tap before install:
      brew trust julianabeleda/tap
